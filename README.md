dotfiles
===========

### How I set my stuff up

I like to make it easy to update everything. On my computers I usually create
the folder ```~/git``` and clone stuff into it, including these dotfiles.

For my dotfiles, I keep symlinks in my homedir to the corresponding files in this
git repo. That way I can simply ```git pull``` and everything is updated! ```bootstrap.sh```
will do this all for you...theoretically...but I haven't tested it in ages now that
I only really use one or two computers, so use it at your own risk!

I don't really recommend using my dotfiles verbatim. Feel free to steal snippets,
but please develop your own workflow! It's more fun that way. These are the result
of years of fine-tuning and procrastination.

Have a nice day!
