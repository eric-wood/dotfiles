### I like moving things around easily between computers
Sometimes I go on a customization kick and end up changing a bunch of settings for things like my bash_profile or my irssi configs or my tmux and screen configs. From now on, I'll just throw them in here so they're easy to get to.

There's not much else to say, really.
Bye.
